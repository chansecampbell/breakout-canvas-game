#Breakout - the canvas game
---

- This is a simple example of the game **Breakout** made in canvas using ES6 syntax. This version is currently unfinished.

- The newly built ES6 version can be found in `js/game.js`. To run this version you must first do a `npm i` and `webpack` in the terminal. Please note that you need webpack installed globally first to run this command. 

- The original game that I built in ES5 can be found in `js/app.js`. To run this version simply comment it into the html and run the server.

- Both the ES5 and ES6 version can then be run on a simple python server.
